## Problem Definition
In todayâ€™s society, online recommendation systems are practically prevalent. Almost every consumer-facing website we visit, from Flipkart to Netflix, offers us some sort of recommendation. It might be anything from Facebook friend recommendations to books on Flipkart or articles read on a news website. The immediate and concrete benefits of a good recommendation system for salespeople are increased sales and money generation. Users who might be the purchasers as well are frequently overwhelmed by a plethora of choices and possibilities in online business experiences, while also having limited resources and time to devoteto the choosing process. In reality, developing a prediction system for a movie database is extremely closely related to developing a recommendation system. The movies that a user is likely to see will be the recommended products in this case. We aim to develop a prediction system that predicts the movie preferences for an unknown user based on some factors. As describedin the problem statement, we essentially aim to predict whether a user is likely to watch a movie or not.
